🔍 Solution:
This function calculates the total points earned from a list of football match results. Each match is given in the format "x:y", where `x` is our team's score and `y` is the opponent's. It uses `.split(':')` to extract each score, parses them into numbers, and applies the win/tie/loss rules.

✅ Code:
*/
function points(games) { 
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < games.length; i++) {
    let [x, y] = games[i].split(':'); // Destructure scores from "x:y"
    x = parseInt(x); // Convert to integers
    y = parseInt(y);

    if (x > y) {
      count += 3; // Win
    } else if (x === y) {
      count += 1; // Tie
    }
    // Loss = 0 points, nothing to add
  }

  return count;
}
