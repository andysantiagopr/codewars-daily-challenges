Description:
Given a string and an array of indices, rearrange the characters of the string so that each character is placed at the position specified by the corresponding index in the array.

Example:
Input:  str = "abcd", arr = [0, 3, 1, 2]
Output: "acdb"

Code:
function scramble(str, arr) {
  let result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { // Place each character from the original string into the position specified by arr[i]
    result[arr[i]] = str[i];
  }
  return result.join('');
}

Examples:
scramble("abcd", [0, 3, 1, 2]) ➞ "acdb"
scramble("hello", [1, 0, 4, 2, 3]) ➞ "ehllo"
scramble("code", [3, 1, 0, 2]) ➞ "dec o"
