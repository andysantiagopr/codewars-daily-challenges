Challenge:
Nathan loves cycling. Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.
You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded down to the smallest value.

Solution:
- Multiply the time (hours) by 0.5 to get total litres consumed.
- Use Math.floor() to round down to the nearest whole number.
*/

function litres(time) {
  return Math.floor(time * 0.5);
}

// Examples:
// litres(2) => 1
// litres(1.4) => 0
// litres(12.3) => 6
