🔍 Solution:
This function splits a string into words, then iterates through each one to determine the length of the shortest word. `lowest` is initialized with the length of the first word as a reasonable starting point. Comparing each word's length to `lowest` ensures we update only when a shorter word is found.

✅ Code:
*/
function findShort(s) {
  let splitted = s.split(' '); 
  let lowest = splitted[0].length; // Establishes a decent starting point. If initialized with 0, it would always be false since no word has length 0.
  for (let i = 0; i < splitted.length; i++) {
    if (splitted[i].length <= lowest) { // No need for lowest.length — it's already a number. Using lowest.length would return undefined.
      lowest = splitted[i].length;
    } 
  }
  return lowest;
}
