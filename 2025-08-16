Function: likes(names)
Purpose: Return a social media-style string based on how many people like something.
*/

function likes(names) {
  if (names.length === 0) {
    // No names in the array → default response
    return "no one likes this";
  } 
  else if (names.length === 1) {
    // One person → singular verb "likes"
    return `${names[0]} likes this`;
  } 
  else if (names.length === 2) {
    // Two people → "X and Y like this"
    return `${names[0]} and ${names[1]} like this`;
  } 
  else if (names.length === 3) {
    // Three people → "X, Y and Z like this"
    return `${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${names[2]} like this`;
  } 
  else {
    // More than 3 → show first two names, then "X others"
    const startIndex = 2; // used to calculate the "others"
    return `${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${names.length - startIndex} others like this`;
  }
}

/*
Examples:
likes([]) → "no one likes this"
likes(["Peter"]) → "Peter likes this"
likes(["Jacob", "Alex"]) → "Jacob and Alex like this"
likes(["Max", "John", "Mark"]) → "Max, John and Mark like this"
likes(["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"]) → "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"

Challenge 2: "Reversed Strings"
Link: https://www.codewars.com/kata/5168bb5dfe9a00b126000018
Profile: https://www.codewars.com/users/andysantiagopr

Function: solution(str)
Purpose: Reverse a given string and return it.
*/

function solution(str) {
  // split('') → convert string into an array of characters
  // reverse() → reverse the array order
  // join('') → join back into a string with no spaces
  return str.split('').reverse().join('');
}

/*
Example:
solution("world") → "dlrow"
solution("hello") → "olleh"
*/
```
