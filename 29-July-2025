Difficulty: 7 kyu  
User Profile: https://www.codewars.com/users/andysantiagopr  

Description:
Check if at least one developer in the list has "Ruby" as their language.

Code:
function isRubyComing(list) {
  return list.some(dev => dev.language === 'Ruby'); // The .some() method checks if at least one element in the array satisfies the condition.
                                                    // It stops iterating as soon as it finds a match and returns true.
}

Examples:
isRubyComing([
  { firstName: 'Alice', language: 'Python' },
  { firstName: 'Bob', language: 'Ruby' }
]); 
// Output: true

isRubyComing([
  { firstName: 'Alice', language: 'Python' },
  { firstName: 'Bob', language: 'JavaScript' }
]);
// Output: false
*/
