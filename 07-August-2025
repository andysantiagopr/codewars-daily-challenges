📝 Summary:
Completed the "Count the Digit" challenge where the goal was to count how many times a given digit appears in the squares of all numbers from 0 to n.


📂 Code:
function nbDig(n, d) {
  let count = 0;
  
  for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {          // Loop through every number from 0 to n
    let square = i * i;                   // Calculate the square of the current number
    let squareStr = square.toString();    // Convert the result to a string so you can inspect each digit
    let targetDigit = d.toString();       // Convert the target digit to a string for comparison
  
    for (let char of squareStr) {         // Check each character in the squared string
      if (char === targetDigit) {
        count++;
      }
    }
  }
  return count;
}

🧪 Examples:
nbDig(10, 1) ➞ 4  
nbDig(25, 1) ➞ 11
